### Pages / Routes

* `/` (Alternatives: `/landing`,`/home`,`/game`)
  * 🌅 Basically, this is the main page. But it kinda behaves more like the background to the rest of the app. At least in regards to pages & url routes.  
  * We had to included a `Home` component page that's empty in the `/app.js` file. to hold the pace for pages that are only the main page.... yes it's odd.
  * All other pages with endpoints are "overlays" over this "background" main page

* `/signup`
* `/signin`
* Default: `*` > 404 page

* `/leaderboard`
* `/dashboard`
